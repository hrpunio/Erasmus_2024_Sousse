NUTS 2 –- regions (voivodships or parts of a voivodship) –- 17 units

NUTS 3 –- subregions (grouping powiats) – 73 units

## TERYT: territorial division of Poland

There are 16 provinces,

380 counties and 

2750 communities in Poland.

As population in Poland is 38,5 mln and the area equals 312,7
sq kilometers (120 persons per 1 sqkm) 
on the average each powiat has 820 sqkm and each community
has 113.5 sqkm or approximately 100 thousand persons per "powiat and 14 thousand per "gmina".

**Province** in Polish is "prowincja" (due to both are from Latin) but actually
Polish administrative provice is called **województwo**, from *wodzić* -- ie commanding (the armed
troops in this context).  
This is an old term/custom from the 14th century,
where Poland was divided into provinces (every province
ruled by a *wojewoda* ie chief of that province). 
More can be found
at Wikipedia (cf [Administrative divisions of Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_Poland))

A Polish county called **powiat** is 2-nd level administrative unit.
In ancient Poland powiat was called
*starostwo* and the head of a starostwo was called *starosta*.
"Stary" means Old, so
"starosta" is an old (and thus wise) person.
BTW the head of powiat is "starosta" as 600 years ago:-)

**TERYT** is an official register of the territorial division of Poland
It is complex system which includes
identification of administrative units.
Every unit has (up to) a 7-digit id number: wwppggt
where ww = "województwo" id, pp = "powiat" id, gg = "gmina" id and "t" decodes **type-of-community**
(rural, municipal or mixed). Higher units has trailing zeros for irrelevant part of id, so
14 or 1400000 means the same; as well as 1205 and 1205000.
Six numbers is enough to identify
a community (approx 2750 units).
