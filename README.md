## Lecture 1: Quality statistical charts: introduction to data visualisation 

Abstract: As pictures have become an increasingly
ubiquitous means of disseminating the results of statistical
analysis, the skills required to create clear and high-quality
statistical charts are of utmost importance. Yet, in reality, one
can easily find countless examples of poor-quality graphics,
often produced by renowned publishers.
     
In this lecture, I will demonstrate how to produce high-quality
statistical graphics. I will cover dot plots, bar charts, line
plots, histograms, kernel density estimates, strip charts,
multi-panel displays, scatterplots, and more.
